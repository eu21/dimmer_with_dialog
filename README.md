            <h2>Dimmer for LINUX</h2>
            <div class="wrap">
Dimmer is a little free application designed to help control the brightness of your computer screen, specially to reduce the brightness beyond what the hardware alone is capable of. This becomes very useful when you are in total darkness and the minimum brightness from your display is still too much. It can dim all screens and monitors; LCD, TFT and LED backlit types. Dimmer will not damage your screen or monitor in any way, if anything, it might actually save the backlight and consequently, energy, by making it emit less radiation. To note is the fact that most desktop screens are actually capable of reducing the brightness levels quite low, the same is not true on almost all laptop, notebook and netbook displays. Dimmer was conceived to work on all versions of&nbsp; Linux OS such as Kubuntu, Fedora, Ubuntu, SUSE.<br>
<br>
Screen brightness adjustment the easy way<br>
<br>
The need for this program came about because I do allot of work at night and with minimum ambient light in the room, or (more often than I would like) in bed and my laptop (all of them) output a great deal of light even in the lowest setting, this was damaging to my eyes and I couldn't work well. So one day I decided to develop Dimmer and solve the problem. I can now dim the laptop display to suit my needs and can finally work through the night without a problem with a dimmed screen. Your monitor brightness can be easily adjusted and the program sits in the system tray for your convenience.<br>
<br>
Another convenient feature is that Dimmer does not require installation, its a portable application. Simply extract into a folder of your choice and run. The program stores its settings in an ini file in the program folder. When no longer needed, just delete the folder and you are done.<br>
<br>
Dimmer has been much acclaimed for its simplicity as the best dimming software for portable displays, screens or monitors and it will be even better in the next version. Feel free to recommend it to your friends and family and you may link to this page if you wish. Hope you enjoy the software.</span></p>
